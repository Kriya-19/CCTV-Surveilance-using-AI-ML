## 🧠 Project Overview

This project provides an intelligent CCTV surveillance framework designed for **hostel/security monitoring** by leveraging **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** and **Machine Learning (Roboflow models)**. It detects and reports on:

- 🚨 **Fight detection**
- 🔓 **Unauthorized access & anomalies**
- 🛡️ **Guard inactivity monitoring**
- 📊 **Real-time alerts & dashboard visualization**

The system is built to integrate with existing cameras and enhance situational awareness in real time. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
